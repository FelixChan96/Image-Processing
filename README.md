Please read the description below before checking out the report PDFs as well as the Python scripts for each processing task. 

**Description of tasks**

1. Image Recognition (Japanese character recognition)

Implementing networks to recognise handwritten Hiragana symbols. The dataset to be used is Kuzushiji-MNIST or KMNIST for short. Significant changes occurred to the language when Japan reformed their education system in 1868, and the majority of Japanese today cannot read texts published over 150 years ago.
