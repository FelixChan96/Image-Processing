# Image & Language Processing Sample Work 
A new repository for a previous task on image and language recognition

Please read the description below before checking out the report PDFs as well as the Python scripts for each processing task. 

**Description of tasks**

1. Image Recognition (Japanese character recognition)

Implementing networks to recognise handwritten Hiragana symbols. The dataset to be used is Kuzushiji-MNIST or KMNIST for short. Significant changes occurred to the language when Japan reformed their education system in 1868, and the majority of Japanese today cannot read texts published over 150 years ago. The dataset contains 10 Hiragana characters with 7000 samples per class. This is the dataset we will be using.

2. Language Recognition 

Implementing a Pytorch program that learns to read business reviews in text format and predict a rating (positive or negative) associated with each review, as well as a business category (0=Restaurants, 1=Shopping, 2=Home Services, 3=Health & Medical, 4=Automotive).
